# Important

- This is not for exploiting in games its for Script Developers to develop scripts like AutoFarms etc. you cant possibly exploit in a game with this its a UTILITY TOOL.
- Everyone is allowed to get the script's code and do whatever they want to do with it.
- I made this for myself but i wanted to publish it thats why the GUI sucks.

# Execution

- Every exucutor should work inject and execute the script below.

```lua
  loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noritery/utilitytool-getpos/refs/heads/main/main"))()
```
